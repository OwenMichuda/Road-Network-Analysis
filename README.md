# Road Network Analysis
## Final Project CS 225
## Erin Dowdy, Hania Dziurdzik, Fantah Kabba, Owen Michuda

### Objectives

Our objective for this project was to use a BFS (breadth first search) and the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a road network, with the roads acting as the edges of the graph. From their, we aim to produce a visual output of the shortest path on a graph image.

### Algorithms

In this project we use BFS and A* search algorithms to find the shortest path between two nodes.
- BFS
  - Finds the shortest path by number of edges traveled.
- A*
  - Finds the shortest path taking into account edge weight.
