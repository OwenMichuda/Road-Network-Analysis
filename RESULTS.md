## I. Outcomes

This project is designed to take any two CSV files of vertices and edges with the format (index, x-coordinate, y-coordinate) and (index, vertex 1, vertex 2, weight) and produce a graph of the network. From there we use the BFS and A* search algorithms to find the shortest path between two arbitrary nodes.
