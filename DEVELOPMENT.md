# DEVELOPMENT LOG
## WEEK 1 (11/18-11/25)
### 11/18
Created/finished team contract
Determined what our deliverables were (BFS traversal, A* search, Projecting onto graph)
Found our data set
Created/finished project goals sheet
The first week of the project involved meeting together to determine what our project goals were and to set up a team contract. During that time, we found our data set and chose what traversals and algorithms we would use. We decided on BFS traversal and A* search with a goal to compare the efficiency of the two. We also chose to project our data onto a map with a red line indicating what path was chosen between two nodes. We also set up meeting times for after break, since we were all going to be gone for most of Thanksgiving break.
## WEEK 2 (11/26-12/3)
### 11/30
Created classes edge, graph, random (and associated files)
Imported cs225 PNG class (and associated classes)
### 12/1
Preliminary READ.me updates
The second week of development occurred after Thanksgiving break. We met over Zoom and started implementing some classes that we felt were necessary to start our development process. This included the graph class given to us through lab_ml as well as the cs225 namespace classes, more specifically the PNG class. We also dove deep into researching how to parse our data files, since we realized that we would have to use two different files to get all the necessary data. We also updated our READ.me file to keep everything up to date.
## WEEK 3 (12/4-12/11)
### 12/4
Had meeting with our group mentor about our plans
### 12/6
Set up meeting time on the 7th
